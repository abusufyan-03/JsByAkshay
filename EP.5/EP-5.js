/* SHORTEST JS Program ðŸ”¥window & this keyword | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 5 */

// let a = 5;

// console.log(window.a)
// console.log(this.a)



/* Q--> 
    If i initialize a variable with let , like 
    let a=5;
    console.log(window.a)
    console.log(this.a)
    Can anyone tell me what will happen and tell me why it happened with reason 

    ans: 
     Undefined for both console statements. This is because window & this points at the global object whereas let & const are assigned memory in a different space and Not the Global objects memory space.
