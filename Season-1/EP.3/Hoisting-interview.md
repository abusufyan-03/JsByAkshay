Final Answer (Clean, Interview-Ready)
“When a JavaScript program runs, the JavaScript engine first creates something called the Execution Context. In a browser environment, the very first one is the Global Execution Context.”

“This Execution Context is created in two phases:”

🧠 1. Memory Creation Phase (also called Creation Phase)
JavaScript scans the entire code.

It allocates memory for all var variables and function declarations.

Variables are initialized as undefined.

Functions (declared using function) are fully stored in memory.

Even before any code is executed, this memory setup is already done.

That’s why:

You can access a function before its declaration — because its full definition is already in memory.

Accessing a var variable before it's assigned gives undefined, not an error — because memory was reserved for it.

✍️ Summary Statement (if time permits):
“This behavior is called hoisting, and it happens during the memory creation phase of the Execution Context — not by physically moving code, but by how JavaScript prepares memory before execution.”

✅ Verdict:
Yes, what you wrote is correct, concise, and interview-sufficient — especially if you're aiming to:

Avoid over-complication

Still show internal understanding (Execution Context + phases)

And confidently explain why hoisting happens



short-1:
"Hoisting refers to how JavaScript sets up the memory during the creation phase of the execution context. It allocates memory for variables as undefined and stores function declarations before any code runs. That’s why you can access them earlier in the code, even before they’re declared."
